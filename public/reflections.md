# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. For loops: For loops are typically used when you know the exact value you need or the exact value you are going to use. This loops a task or displays something until it reaches a certain number/limit.
2. While loops: While loops are typically used when you don't know the value being initialized. This displays something or does a task as long as its conditions are met.
3. If-else statements: This basically sets a condition for something to be able to do a specific task. It includes else if statements for different variables, and this may trigger different tasks and/or display different things. 
4. Arithmetic operators: These are symbols that can be used in mathematical equations. They can also be used for loops, for loops as an example, to make the counter increase or decrease.
5. Output using console.log: Using console.log displays speech, numbers, etc. This can be used to show the results of a function or the results of a certain code.
# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 
1. Custom functions: I usually forget how to declare custom functions, or I end up making mistakes in making the function itself.
2. Processing function outputs: I'm not very sure how to use the return statement.
3. Loop control structures: I got used to rarely ever using breaks, continue statements, and etc., and some of the statements are also a little new to me.
4. Some nested loops: Especially when I have to make shapes, I occasionally forget which loops to nest (+ it's an issue I've had since C++).
5. Number properties: I don't think I was able to note down the numper properties, unable to study them in depth.
# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. Create a study routine and/or schedule
2. Practice and practice with exercises online
3. Ask my classmates for help
# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
* Effective
1. Coding practice exercises: They really tug at my braincells, but I think that's a good thing. They really sharpen one's problem solving skills and creativity!!!
2. Bonus Exercises: It not only helps get in more practice, but it motivates students to work harder for the bonus.
* Uneffective
1. Whole table group activities: Don't get me wrong, my table-mates are amazing. I, personally, don't think it worked for me cause I didn't have to analyze a lot as my groupmates were really quick.
